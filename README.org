* Herbstluftwm Configuration
This is my configuration of [[http://herbstluftwm.org/][herbstluftwm]], a manual tiling window manager for X11.

This configuration follows the [[https://xmonad.org/][XMonad]]-style configuration but is written in Nim. 
** Prerequisites
You will need the following programs to use this configuration:

- herbstluftwm
- Nim >= 0.19
- gxmessage
** Installation
Clone this repository to =~/.config/herbstluftwm=. 
** Usage
Once set, start herbstluftwm as usual. That is, you will probably want to create =~/.xinitrc= file with the following content:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
exec herbstluftwm --locked
#+END_SRC

=autostart= script in the repository builds the configuration at startup. An error message is displayed if Nim fails to build the configuration.
** Tweaking
Edit =config.nim= to suit your need. After you finish it, reload your configuration as normal (~Mod-Shift-r~ by default).
